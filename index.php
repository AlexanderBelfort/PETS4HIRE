					<h3>What is Pets4Hire?</h3>
					<p>
						Simply put “Pets4Hire“ allows you to borrow a pet for however long suits you. 
						We have a range of animals that you can borrow, for a day or two up to a year.  
						You select which type of pet you’d like to borrow and when, and we deal with the rest.  
						They’ll arrive for their stay with you equipped with everything we can practically provide to start their stay including toys, comfy beds, and some food.  
						When home time comes, we’ll pick your new friend up, and leave you with a personalised memento to remember their stay.
					</p>
					<h3>Why we started Pets4Hire?</h3>
					<p>
						We know having a pet is a big commitment! 
						Whether it is finding time to wash and groom them, arranging care for when you’re travelling, the worry of vets bills, or simply not having enough space to have one all the time, there are lots of reasons not to get one.  
						However, we also know that there are many great benefits from having animals in our lives.  
						They can decrease depression, stress, and anxiety, lower blood pressure, and maybe even extend your life!  
						That’s why we started Pets4Hire - to give everybody the opportunity to have some one-to-one time with a pet of their choice.
