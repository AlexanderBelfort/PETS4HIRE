								<div class="col-sm-9">
									<h3>Description:</h3> Our most exciting pet's the mythical dragon.  We have done our best to tame these wild beasts, but they can still be very stubborn and hard to control, especially for newbies.  We therefore recommend that they are only siutable for very experienced pet owners, with at least some background in sorcery.  These are very high cost and high maintenance pets, so hiring one is a great way to determine if it's the pet for you.  Beware, we have in the past received many complains from customer's neighbours about this pet due to its size and effects of the fire it breathes.  Dragons are ideal pets for farmers and castle owners.<br>
									Foods: dragons enjoy herds of sheep, spicy chicken kebabs, and sugar-free potions<br>
									Likes: princesses, conquering kingdoms, barbeque

								</div>
								<div class="col-sm-9">
									<br><h3>Description:</h3> One of the most majesitc sights, watching an eagle soaring high above.  These birds are very focused, with great eye sight and attentoin to detail, meaning they are especially suitable for corporate customers.  Well trained to follow commands they are great for delivering small packages with high priority as they simply fly above traffic jams and take out any drones in their way.  Please note, our eagles do not particularly like being part of big grounds of people, preferring to watch from a distance.  Please keep eagles inside during storms for their safety.<br>
									Foods: chicken, mice, burritos, subway<br>
									Likes: chasing rabbits, circling around the chimney, fetching drones

								<div class="col-sm-9">
									<br><h3>Description:</h3> Some people think these are among the most intelligent pets that we have for hire, all we know is that elephants are very clever, very patient, and suitable for those with LOTS of free space in their house.  Our elephants are very creative, possessing a range of artistic skils, with a special focus on musical instruments. They can also be very helpful with the shopping or tidying up the garden as they can cary large items and poeple for long distances with ease.  Before yoru elephant arrives for their stay, we recommend conducting a through sweep of your house for mice as these tiny creatures can scare elephants.<br>
									Food: leaves, fruit, vegan chocolate bars<br>
									Likes: showering, sitting on cars, playing musical instruments

								<div class="col-sm-9">
									<br><h3>Description:</h3> Very resilient (they have been around since the dinosaurs) animals, crocodiles are very low maintenance and hassle free  as long as there are some other animals around crocodiles will look after mealtime themselves.  They have been tested and are certified waterproof up to a depth of 15 meters, and make team mates for water related activities, such as water polo, team swimming, and diving.  However, please remember they can be short tempered so try not to argue with them too much; as such, we recommend they are only suitable for more advanced and experienced pet owners.<br>
									Food: chicken, fish, other pets, olives<br>
									Likes: rolling in the water, sunbathing, cuddling

								<div class="col-sm-9">
									<br><h3>Description:</h3> What can we say about the wonderful, loyal and friendly pet that is a dog.  These fantastic animals are water resistant (although we recommend drying thoroughly when wet) and suitable for all general outdoor and indoor activities.  Great with children, adults, cats, and the elderly, our dogs are well trained, obedient, and come with a great knowledge of French wines.  They can also patrol a specified perimeter up to 12 hours per day; however, if nothing is going on, they may decide to have a nap.  Please note, we are unable to advise on the breed, colour, or size of dog that you will be provided with.<br>

								</div>
								<div class="col-sm-9">
									<br><h3>Description:</h3> Still wondering what to do with that tree that is growing through your window? It would provide a perfect habitat for a sloth to stay in!  They are very quiet companions, with very low demands making them especially suitable for older customers. While asleep for most of the day, our sloths do like to make the most of their awake time, looking around, hugging people, and enjoying listening to opera and heavy metal music.<br>

									Likes: sleep, doing nothing, watching the grass grow
